## 📋 CASE STUDY: JENESYS AI

### Title
**Scaling an AI-Powered Fintech Platform from MVP to Impact**

### Overview
As the Founding Product Designer at Jenesys, I led design for an AI-driven accounting system that automated invoice and receipt management for small businesses. My goal was to simplify workflows while building scalable, compliant systems.

Jenesys is an AI-powered bookkeeping platform that automates financial workflows for SMEs. You can connect your accounting system (Xero, QuickBooks, FreeAgent), upload invoices via email, and let AI handle categorization, reconciliation, and compliance tracking — all while maintaining the transparency that financial professionals demand.

---

### My Role
**Leading Design from Zero to Scale**

Led product discovery, UX strategy, design systems, prototyping, and developer handoff. Collaborated with founders, PMs, and engineers to align design with business goals and technical constraints.

**Key Contributions:** 
- Built the complete UX foundation from scratch
- Established design processes
- Created 40+ reusable components
- Designed 8 core workflows
- Prepared investor-ready demos that helped secure $2.2M in funding

**Impact-Driven Approach:** 
Advocated for AI transparency in UX, designing patterns where AI explained its reasoning to build user trust. This became a competitive advantage and influenced how the team approached all product decisions.

---

### Process
1. **Discover** — Conducted user interviews, mapped current pain points in document handling
2. **Define** — Identified key problems: data inaccuracy, poor categorization, friction in approvals
3. **Design** — Built modular flows and reusable UI patterns in Figma, integrated with APIs
4. **Deliver** — Partnered with engineering to test early prototypes and iterate on live feedback

---

### Results & Impact
- **60%** — Reduced document processing time
- **40%** — Increased accuracy through AI validation
- **80%** — Feature adoption rate across core workflows
- **3x** — Daily active user growth
- **$1M** — ARR achieved in 12 months
- **3 products** — Built a scalable design system now used across

---

### Reflection
This project reinforced how design systems accelerate iteration speed and maintain clarity across fast-scaling teams. I learned to balance AI complexity with simplicity for everyday users — a challenge that required deep collaboration with engineers and continuous user feedback.

## 📋 CASE STUDY: RECEIPT2RECIPE

### Title
**An AI Experiment That Turns Grocery Receipts Into Meal Ideas**

### Overview
Receipt2Recipe is an AI experiment that turns grocery receipts into meal ideas. Built in under a week using Cursor and Figma, it explores how we can make meal planning effortless by starting with what you actually bought — not what you wish you had.

**The Concept:** Snap a photo of your grocery receipt. AI reads the items, understands what you have, and generates a week of meal ideas. No manual input. No endless recipe browsing. Just practical, achievable meals based on what's in your kitchen.

---

### My Role
**Rapid Prototyping & UX Design**

Designed the complete user flow — from receipt snap to meal suggestions — in under a week. Used Cursor for rapid prototyping and Figma for polished UI. The goal was to test if receipt-based meal planning could feel magical while staying practical.

**Key Challenge:** Making complex AI processes (OCR, ingredient matching, recipe generation) feel simple and trustworthy. The answer was showing just enough detail to build confidence without overwhelming users.

**Design Approach:** Mobile-first, one-handed interactions, instant feedback. Designed for busy shoppers who want answers now — not complex settings menus.

---

### Reflection
Building Receipt2Recipe in under a week taught me that speed and creativity thrive together. By focusing on one core insight — that people want meal plans based on what they actually have — I could strip away complexity and design for delight.

## 📋 CASE STUDY: BORLAPAY

### Title
**Making Recycling Rewarding in Ghana**

### Overview
BorlaPay turns Ghana's recycling problem into an opportunity by making it rewarding. Drop off your plastic waste with a local "Wastepreneur," scan a QR code, and get paid instantly through mobile money. Simple as that.

**The Problem:** Ghana generates 1M+ tons of plastic waste annually, but only 5% gets recycled. Why? No reward, no community support, and no way to see your impact. Meanwhile, 70% of Ghanaians use mobile money daily — a ready-made trust layer waiting to be tapped.

**The Solution:** A mobile-first platform that mirrors the MoMo apps Ghanaians already love. Familiar UI. Instant rewards. Community-driven trust. The result? 80% retention and 3x waste collection.

---

### My Role
**Lead Product Designer**

Led research, strategy, and complete UX design. Conducted 8 interviews across Accra, Kumasi, and Tamale to understand why people don't recycle and how they use mobile money. The insight? Trust community members over institutions, and familiar UX beats novelty every time.

**Design Approach:** Mirrored mobile money apps Ghanaians already love. Familiar flows. Instant rewards. Community-first trust mechanics. Designed a two-sided marketplace where "Wastepreneurs" collect waste and users get paid — all through interfaces that feel like home.

**Key Insight:** People don't need to be convinced to recycle. They need to be rewarded and supported by their community. The UX just needed to get out of the way.

---

### Results
- **80%** User Retention Rate
- **3x** Waste Collection Increase
- **70%** Mobile Money Integration Success

---
